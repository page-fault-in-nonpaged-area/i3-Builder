## Installation

The recommended way to install i3-Builder is to prepare everything on an USB or network drive, along with all the required inputs.

### 1. Preparing inputs

1. Firefox
  - Copy everything in `.mozilla/firefox/[id].default` in your current firefox profile into `input/ff.` To find out where `[id].default` is located, goto `about:profiles` in firefox.

2. Git-profiles
  - `git-profiles/profiles.sample.yml` contains an sample yml of various git profiles the polybar git widget can cycle through with clicks. When ready, rename this file to `git-profiles/profiles.yml`. Please note the polybar widget will only work if you have the keys.

3. Keys
  - `input/keys/ssh` and `input/keys/gpg` contain keys to be copied onto the new system. `input/keys/ssh` and `input/keys/gpg` should contain the contents of the `~/.ssh` and `~/.gnupg` on your current system, respectively.

### 2. Run `./install.sh`

- Run `./install.sh` and answer a few prompts! If no errors, log out, log back in, and enjoy your new i3 desktop! 

### 3. Errors and troubleshooting

- If you run into any errors, logs should be available in `output/logs`. Please see [known issues](#known-issues) for more information.

## Known Issues

- Depending on the complexity of your firefox profile, this tool **_may_** fail when copying your firefox profile onto the new system. In that case, please see the [Firefox docs](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles) on this topic.

- As of Ubuntu 22.04, firefox is installed via snap by default. The snap version of Firefox does not support gtk cursor themes. If you wish to fix this, simply switch to the apt version of firefox. Please See [this](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1432088/mouse-cursor-changes-theme-in-firefox) for more information.
